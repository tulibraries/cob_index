Cob Index is a repository to hold the traject configuration files and scripts
associated with indexing of the tul_cob books catalog.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cob_index'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cob_index

## Usage

### ingest

`cob_index` is an executable.  You can use it to ingest files into SOLR_URL with

```
cob_index ingest $path_to_file
```

`$path_file` can also be a URL.


#### Ingest switches
`--commit` If this switch is passed (`cob_index ingest --commit`), then cob_index will send commit at end of ingest process.

### deletes

```
cob_index delete  $path_to_file
```

### harvest

```
cob_index harvest  --type=alma-electronic
```

Runs pre defined harvesting endpoints for tul_cob. Note the only type currently defined is for the alma-electronic api and thus it is set by default.

#### Harvest endpoint types
##### alma-electronic
`collection_notes.json` and `service_notes.json` files get outputed to the working directory when `cob_index harvest --type=alma-electronic` is run.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
