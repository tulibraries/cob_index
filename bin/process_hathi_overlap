# This script requires two files to be passed in as parameters
# 1) HathiTrust Full Export file, available at https://www.hathitrust.org/hathifiles. Prefer the most recent file.
# 2) HathiTrust Overlap File, to which metadata team can provide access. Documented at https://www.hathitrust.org/hathitrust-overlap-reports.
# This script processes those files to generate a series of lookup files containing :
# * the OCLC number for a HathiTrust item
# * the HathiTrust Bib Key for that item
# * the access status of theat item, which is either allow, or deny.
# It will output 10 files (trailing_{0-9}.csv) in the directory where it is run, plus 3 dated intermediate files that are used as part of the process.
